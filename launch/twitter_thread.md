# Twitter/X Launch Thread

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your docs are stale. You know it. Your team knows it. Your users definitely know it.

I built something to fix that. Meet Tome — it watches your code and opens PRs to keep your docs current.

Not a chatbot. A docs engineer.

🧵

## Tweet 2 (Problem)
Every team has the same problem:

- Developer ships a feature
- Docs don't get updated
- 3 months later someone asks "is this still accurate?"
- Nobody knows

Documentation debt compounds faster than tech debt.

## Tweet 3 (Solution)
Tome hooks into your GitHub repo via webhook.

Every push → LLM-powered diff analysis → gap detection → auto-generated PR

It matches your existing doc style and opens a PR you can review like any other.

## Tweet 4 (Proof)
The first PR Tome ever opened was on its own repo.

It analyzed its own commit, detected 3 missing doc sections, generated 290 lines of documentation, and opened a PR.

Self-dogfooding from minute one.

## Tweet 5 (Differentiation)
"Isn't this just another AI docs tool?"

No. Chatbase, DocsBot, etc help users SEARCH your docs.

Tome WRITES them. It detects when code changes make docs stale and fixes it automatically.

Different category entirely.

## Tweet 6 (CTA)
Pricing starts at $9/mo. 14-day free trial on every plan.
